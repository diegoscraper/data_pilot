# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - implement a new HTTP GET /messages/{message_id} route to allow users to view single, specific
#  messages by id

# - this should be an authenticated route

# - the authenticated user should not be allowed to view private messages posted by other users

# - though private messages posted by the authenticated user should be accessible

# - the route should return the message as json but show only 3 attributes: the id of the message,
#  its content and when it was created. For example:

    # {
    #   "id": 6,
    #   "message": "a sample msg",
    #   "created_at": "2022-10-16T21:00:39.541505"
    # }
