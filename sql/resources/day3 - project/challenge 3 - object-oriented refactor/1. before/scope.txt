# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - refactor the code responsible for saving the user to the database so that is relies on a behavior
# of the Database class instead with the following signature:

    #     db.write(table: str, columns: list[str], values: list)

# e.g. instead of our current context manager insert statement, we'd say:
#     db.write('users', ['email', 'password'], [email, hashed_password]) -> int

    # * the first argument "users" specifies the table name
    # * the second argument indicates the list of columns we're inserting into
    # * the third argument reflects the values being inserted

# in addition, also ensure that the .write() method of the Database type returns the id of the
# newly inserted record
