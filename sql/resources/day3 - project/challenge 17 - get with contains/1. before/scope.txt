# - refactor the implementation for Database .get() so that it supports the LIKE operator too

# - unlike .get_contains(), we're looking for more precise search alongisde specific columns
# and values, specified in a dictionary

# importantly, there could be more than one key-value, which should be combined with logical OR

# - suggested signature:

    # def get_contains(self, table: str, columns: list[str], search: str, limit: int = None):
    #     pass

# - sample usage:

    # db.get_contains("table", ["col1", "col2"], "trm", 2)

# should generate

    # SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE col1 LIKE '%trm%' or col2 LIKE '%trm%' LIMIT 2;

# - the method should fetch and return all records returned by the dynamically generated query
