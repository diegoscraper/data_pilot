#
# Scope of work:
# - complete the implementation for Choice 3
#
# - the user should specify a box by name (not by id)
#
# - the program should confirm that such a box exists
#
# - if it does, the user should specify a container id
#
# - the program should ensure that a container does not store more than 30 units
# of volume (e.g. cubic meters)
#
# - if any of the "happy path" conditions are not met, the user is notified of
# the problem with a descriptive message, after which the program returns to
# the main menu
