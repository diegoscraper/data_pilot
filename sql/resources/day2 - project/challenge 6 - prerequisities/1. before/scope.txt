# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - introduce a new database table to model course prerequisites

# - the table should capture:
#   * course: for which the prerequisite applies
#   * prereq: the prerequisitive of the course
#   * min_grade: the minimum grade the student should have earned in the prereq

# - we should also validate that course and prereq are valid courses, e.g.
# they should be foreign keys to courses table, not just any values

# - further, min_grade should be validated to be between 0 and 100

# - try to define the validations as part of the data model in SQL, rather than in
# python

# - finally, introduce a new 'add-prereq' command to the interface and implement
#  the functionality required for the user to add prerequisites to the database
