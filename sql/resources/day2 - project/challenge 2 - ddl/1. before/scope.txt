# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - write the DDL to define the students and courses tables

# - students should store
#     * first_name
#     * last_name
#     * unix_id (a short-hand unique identifier that the school assigns to each student)

# - courses should store
#     * moniker (a short-form id, like ECON101),
#     * name (the full name of the course),
#     * department

# ...in addition to their respective primary keys

# - BONUS: see if you could separate the DDL out into a standalone file rather than storing
# it in python strings
