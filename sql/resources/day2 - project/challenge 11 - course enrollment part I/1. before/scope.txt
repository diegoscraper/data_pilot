# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - define a new table to record course enrollments, e.g. a student_course table that stores the
# following

    # * student: the student's unix id, e.g. jd1
    # * course: the course's moniker, e.g. CS304
    # * year: the year in which the user enrolled, e.g. 2023
    # * grade: the grade the student has earned in the course

# - in terms of data integrity,
    # * please ensure student and course are valid references to the entities they relate to, not
    # just any value, and
    # * a student cannot enroll in the same course in the same year more than once, and
    # * the grade should be an integer between 0 and 100

# - add a new command called "enroll" that enrolls a student into the course.

# at this point, it's NOT necessary to check that the prerequisites are met.
