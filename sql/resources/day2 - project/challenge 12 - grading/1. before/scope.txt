# - define a new command called 'grade' which should update the grade in an enrollment record, e.g.
    # python registrar.py grade jd1 econ101 100
    # ...would update jd1's econ101 grade to 100

# - the method should also accept an optional year argument to support use cases where a grade is
# being upgraded for a course taken in a previous year. If this argument, is not specified, it
#  defaults to the current year.
    #     jd1 econ101 2021 90 -> updates the 2021 enrollment
    #     jd1 econ101 90      -> updates the current (runtime) year enrollment
