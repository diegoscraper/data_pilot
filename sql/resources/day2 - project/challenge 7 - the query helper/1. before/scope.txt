# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - abstract away the cursor creation and statement execution into a standalone
# helper called query()

# - query() should take a connection, a SQL statement, and some data and handle
# the execution of the statement

# - the method's signature should support DDL, DML, and DQL statements and get
# cues as to what it's running from the method signature, e.g.
    # query(conn, q, data=("a", "b))  -> DML because data arg passed in
    # query(conn, q, fetch=True)      -> DQL that wants results back
    # query(conn, q)                  -> DDL or DQL, no results returned

# - finally, refactor the other database helpers to use the query helper instead
