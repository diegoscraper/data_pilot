# SCOPE OF WORK    #
####################

# - create some student, course, and prerequisite records

# - offer the user the option to seed the data when they reset the database, so
# the new database would start out with some records instead of completely blank

# - as a bonus, try to keep the above data in python data scrutures and separate
#  from the DDL script

# - as another bonus, try to extend the query() function so that it is useful to
#  carry out single-table, multi-record inserts as part of one invocation
