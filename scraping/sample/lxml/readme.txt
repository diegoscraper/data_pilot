The lxml library is an XML toolkit with a rich library set to process XML and HTML.
lxml is preferred over other XML-based libraries in Python for its high speed and
effective memory management, plus it has various other features to handle both small
and large XML files.

DOM parsing, traversing element trees, XPath, and CSS selector are the features that
make lxml effective and efficient enough for tasks such as web scraping. For more
details on lxml and its documentation, please visit https://lxml.de/.
